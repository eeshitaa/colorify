# Colorify – Image Colorization

## Overview
Research implementation accompanying an **IEEE-published paper** on automatic image colorization using deep learning.

## Approach
- VGG19-based feature extraction
- Fusion autoencoder architecture for color prediction
- Training and evaluation on image datasets

## Tech Stack
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Computer Vision, Deep Learning

## Notes
This repository contains experimental code and notebooks used to explore and validate the approach presented in the paper. The focus is on reproducing results rather than production deployment.
